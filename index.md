### CPSC 120

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 1 was a favorite of mine because I enjoyed making a pattern that
    can be drawn out in the terminal. Although this was one of the more simple
    programs to write, it shows that a couple of for loops combined together can
    create an amazing output.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 2 was another favorite of mine since it utilizes 2D vectors instead
    of regular vectors. This was one of the harder labs to visualize in my head due to
    the 2D vector being used. By using a For loop with the 2D Vector, we were able to 
    display a california county by indexing them. This is relatable to a dictionary.

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 1 and 2 was a favorite because they both had to deal with images using the
    RGB color mechanic and the Magick library. This was fun to learn because it used rng as
    a way to get a gradient image. Overall, the animation of gradients was an overall interesting
    lab since it was using the sin function as well as using pixel color, accounting for the
    column and row of the image.
